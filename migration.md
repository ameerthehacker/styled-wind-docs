## Migration Guide

A simple migration guide to migrate projects using `styled-components` to use `styled-wind`.

### Steps

1. Install `styled-wind` as dependency using `yarn add styled-wind`
2. Find and replace all the occurrence of `import styled from 'styled-components'` to `import styled from 'styled-wind'`
3. Migration is complete and all your components should work without any issues.
4. Going forward, you may choose to add tailwind like classes or just css or a mix a both for your components.
